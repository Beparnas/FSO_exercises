# FSO_exercises
monorepo for the exercises made while completing the University of Helsinki's [FullStackOpen course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)

# structure
Each part of the course is organized into directories.
Summary markdown files are stored in each directory, I use this to keep track of whether I've completed all of the exercises. subdirectories beyond this vary depending on the assignment.
